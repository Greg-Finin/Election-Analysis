# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
For this project we were given a set of election data and asked to retrieve a variety of different information. The data came to us in a CSV file, which we read and analyzed using python. Through the writing of our code we were able to gather the total amount of votes, the percentage of vote each candidate recieved as well as the winning candidate in the elction. To further our analysis we reviewed the votes per county, to review voter turnout. These results are posted in the section below.

## Election Audit Summary
The code that we wrote for this audit could be applied to other elections with few alterations. It stores all of the relevant information in lists and dictionaries, and holds that information to be called whenever it is needed. It would easily adjust to more counties, and more candidates. If you wanted to display the number of votes for each candidate within each county that could be done using another nested for loop and conditional statement. If your data was from several elections, you could store the information in different variables and print out the two results for side to side comparison.
