# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
For this project we were given a set of election data and asked to retrieve a variety of different information. The data came to us in a CSV file, which we read and analyzed using python. Through the writing of our code we were able to gather the total amount of votes, the percentage of vote each candidate recieved as well as the winning candidate in the elction. To further our analysis we reviewed the votes per county, to review voter turnout. These results are posted in the section below.
